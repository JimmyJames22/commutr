Issues with RouteFinder.js
 - routeList contains empty "routes"
 - routeList populated from initRoutes() which calls formRoutes()
   - Means that formRoutes() is probably problematic
   - NOT a problem with drivers list or students list -- they are populated
   - one initRoutes() problem is that driver.distanceToUid(student.uid) always returns 0
 - User.distanceToUid(uid) returns zero when it shouldn't
  - userMap has zero as distance between all users
  - userMap is initialized using the method distanceToUid(uid) which is dependent on userMap definitions already
  - need to rewrite the distanceTo(User) method so that userMap can be populated

Recursively select the best routes for the drivers with no repeat passengers
 - Loop through every driver and all the routes they have
 - check each orientation of routes and look for the one that puts the most gap between max_dist and total_dist while having no repeat users
   - make it recursive so that the method calls itself to find the routes and looks to minimize the loss function

POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR ROUTE FINDER
 - Make non-driver-centric route storage
 - Matching ideal arrival/leaving times if possible
 - Max car capacity
 - Number of rides that are taken/given

ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE TIME UPDATES
 - Make M-F route arrival and dismissal times
 - Make the option to say "I don't care when I leave or arrive"



THE TIMES MUST BE ORGANIZED IN AN OBJECT WHERE THERE'S AN ARRIVAL AND DEPATRUE TIME FOR EACH DAY
